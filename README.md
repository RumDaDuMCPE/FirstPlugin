# FirstPlugin
=======
This is a very useful plugin, it totally add a lot of features to your server such as:

/kit test (gives you 100 diamonds and 100 stone)

/ctime (which just shows a big ass number that makes no sense what so ever) (will fix later)

/cdate (shows current date)

/ping (shows your ping)

and /iraindrop (Just a random command which actually does something, download, put the plugin in your plugins folder, join, and do       /iraindrop for a suprise!)

Any help is appriciated, just tryna learn how to code :P
